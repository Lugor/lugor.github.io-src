:title: About Lugor

While the history of LUGOR is a bit murky we know for certain that the domain name was reserved in June of 1995. LUGOR was formed by a group of people who had a common interest in Linux and free software. We are a diverse group composed of people just exploring Linux to advanced hackers that are coding their own applications on Linux.

If you are interested in Linux and/or Free Software we would welcome you coming to our meetings. Joining is as simple as showing up. There is no fee whatsoever. That's right, it's free - just like Linux
