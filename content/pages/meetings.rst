Lugor traditionally meets on the third Thursday of every month. Currently, we are not holding regular technical meetings due to the lack of presenters. If anyone would like to present they can send an email to one of `the mailing lists <{filename}/pages/maillist.rst>`_ and a schedule for the presentation can be setup.

In place of the technnical meetings LUGOR is still meeting as a Beer SIG and `J.B. Quimby's <http://www.jbquimbys.com/>`_. Qumby's is located at 3259 Winton Road South Rochester, NY 14623 (Henrietta).
Please see the mailing lists for further details about meetings (occasionally they are are cancelled or moved).
