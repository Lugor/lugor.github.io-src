Lugor traditionally meets on the third Thursday of every month. Currently, we are not holding regular technical meetings due to the lack of presenters. If anyone would like to present they can send an email to one of `the mailing list <{filename}/pages/maillist.rst>`_ and a schedule for the presentation can be setup.

In place of technical meetings LUGOR has tentatively resumed some in-person social meetings, aka as the $BEVERAGE SIG (Special Interest Group), at the Henrietta location of  `The Distillery <https://www.thedistillery.com/locations/henrietta>`_. 

The Henrietta location of The Distillery is located on the east side of 3010 South Winton Road, Rochester, NY 14623 (Henrietta) in the southwest corner of `the Winton Place shopping center <https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/304394819#map=15/43.0930/-77.5795>`_.

Please see `the mailing list <{filename}/pages/maillist.rst>`_ for further details about meetings (occasionally they are cancelled or moved).
