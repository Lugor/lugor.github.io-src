As of late fall 2021, workshops are on hiatus at least through the end of the year.

With the rise of social changes associated with the COVID pandemic, those workshops moved in 2020 to Jitsi videoconferencing.

In cooperation with several other groups, LUGOR hosted a Linux Workshop on third Saturdays of the month at the former location of Interlock Rochester.

With Interlock's closure of that location in late autumn 2019 those workshops moved to local public library meeting rooms for a couple of months.

Please see `the mailing lists <{filename}/pages/maillist.rst>`_ for further details about meetings (occasionally they are cancelled or moved).
