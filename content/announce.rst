:title: Lugor Transitions to Pelican

The Linux User Group of Rochester is moving to using `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_. Pelican is a static site generator. It is written in Python and requires no database or server-side logic. 

A static web site generator processes content written in reStructuredText, Markdown or AsciiDoc 
formats to generate static HTML pages. The page layout and structure is controlled by the use of 
themes. With over 100 themes available it is easy to get started.
