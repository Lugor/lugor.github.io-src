We have a lot to catch up on.

Most recently, there has been discussion of what to do with the [mailing lists]({filename}pages/maillist.rst) since the person who has done us such great service in hosting them over the years has had enough, and is looking either to shut them down or transfer responsibility.

In the spring, our [IRC]({filename}pages/irc.rst) switched from the suddenly-conflicted Freenode to the new libera.chat service. Our IRC page here has been updated to reflect this change.

And of course the rise of COVID and adjustments to it have also visited LUGOR, resulting in changes both to our [meetings]({filename}pages/meetings.rst) and to the [Linux Workshop]({filename}pages/workshop.rst). The meeting page has been updated, and a page has been added for the workshop.
