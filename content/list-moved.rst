:title: Changes to mailing lists effected

Planned changes to the mailing lists are now complete.

As was discussed mostly on the *lugor-discuss* mailing list but `also briefly <https://web.archive.org/web/20220218145522/http://list.xcski.com/pipermail/lugor-public/2022-February/000053.html>`_ on the *lugor-public* list, a new mailing list is up and running.

The old lists have been removed from `their previous location <http://list.xcski.com/mailman/listinfo/>`_.  

To subscribe to the new list, please see `the list information page <https://ssl.rd1.net/mail-man/listinfo/lugor>`_. 

Thanks are due Paul for persevering all these years in keeping the old
lists running and for gracefully bowing out from that work, and to Ralph for
stepping up to offer hosting and administration for the new list.
